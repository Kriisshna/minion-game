trees:
    multiple level wise desicion maling is efficient here
    used in router algorithm
    searching of a data from millions of data is efficient here

terms:
nodes-
leaf-
internal node-

trie is a data structure which is mainly used for strings . with this as DS , auto fill, auto crt,etc

binary tree:
    node can have max 2 children 

    types of binary tree:
        complete binary: all levels should be full except last level, at last level all nodes should be left arranged

        strict binary: all node

        perfect binary: all interior nodes have 2 kids and all leaves have have the same depth


    level order:
        depth first:
        -pre order: root-left-right
        -post order: left-right-root
        -in order: left-root-right



Binary tree insertion: 
    if the tree is empty node to be inserted at the root node
    after this two level order traversal which is root left right whenever there's a first free space insert your node
